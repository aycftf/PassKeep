What is PassKeep?
- PassKeep is an offline alternative for a password manager built for Linux (Based and Tested on Ubuntu/Debian)!
- This script uses PGP (pretty good privacy) to encrypt / decrypt passwords, using public priv key infrastructure and cryptography. (RSA, ECDSA, DH)
- Besides encryption at rest however, you can freely generate passwords up to 90 characters, with a threshold for a certain % of special characters needing to be included in the generated password (This is to reduce the usage of commonly guessable passwords using num/regular characters)
- This script allows the user to fully automate the generation, and protection of a password while providing an easy to use interface (OVER THE CLI)
